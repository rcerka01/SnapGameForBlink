## Running the code

The code and tests can be executed traditionally using the following commands:

- `sbt run`
- `sbt test`

## Assumptions

- The code uses Cats effect and Tagles Final. It is controversial if this style is simpler and more readable. Also logging and error handling adds a slight complexity to it. However, it is a job interview task, so, it have to represent some advance aspects as well.
